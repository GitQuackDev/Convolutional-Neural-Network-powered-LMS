## üîÑ Integration Strategy

### Progressive Enhancement Approach
1. **Preserve Existing UI**: Maintain current component structure and styling
2. **Gradual Backend Connection**: Replace mock data incrementally with real APIs
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Ensure graceful degradation if backend unavailable
4. **Integration Checkpoints**: Verify existing functionality remains intact at each step

### Technical Implementation Patterns
```typescript
// Pattern 1: API Service Migration
// FROM: Direct fetch() calls
await fetch('/api/analytics/overview?' + params)

// TO: Centralized API service
await apiService.get('/analytics/overview', { params })

// Pattern 2: WebSocket Namespace Integration  
// FROM: Generic WebSocket connection
const { isConnected } = useWebSocket();

// TO: Namespace-specific hooks
const { analyticsData, isConnected } = useAnalyticsWebSocket();

// Pattern 3: State Management Enhancement
// FROM: Component-level state with mock data
const [data, setData] = useState(mockData);

// TO: Centralized state with real data
const { data, loading, error } = useAnalyticsStore();
```
