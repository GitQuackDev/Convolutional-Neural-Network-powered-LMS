## üìã Story Overview

Enhance the AI analysis experience by building comprehensive progress tracking components and sophisticated results display interfaces that leverage the full OpenRouter backend infrastructure, providing users with detailed insights into multi-AI analysis workflows and consolidated results comparison.

### üéØ User Story

**As a** student/instructor using the AI analysis features  
**I want** comprehensive progress tracking and enhanced results display for multi-AI analysis jobs  
**So that** I can monitor analysis progress in real-time, understand individual model performance, and effectively compare results across different AI models

### üèóÔ∏è Current State Analysis

**Existing Progress Tracking (Partial Implementation)**:
```typescript
// Story 2.4 - Basic progress tracking exists
- LiveAnalysisProgressCard component (basic progress display)
- useAnalyticsWebSocket progress updates
- Real-time progress via WebSocket /analytics namespace

// Story 2.5 - Basic AI analysis interface exists  
- MultiAIAnalysisInterface component (simplified UI)
- AIAnalysisResultsDisplay component (basic results)
- Model health monitoring display
```

**Backend Infrastructure Available**:
```typescript
‚úÖ POST /api/ai-analysis/analyze-multi - Multi-model analysis with progress tracking
‚úÖ GET /api/ai-analysis/progress/:id - Detailed progress by analysis ID  
‚úÖ GET /api/ai-analysis/consolidated/:id - Consolidated insights and comparisons
‚úÖ WebSocket /analytics namespace - Real-time model-specific progress updates
‚úÖ AI Model Factory - GPT-4, Claude, Gemini integration with health monitoring
```

**Critical Enhancement Needs**:
- Detailed progress visualization per AI model
- Enhanced results comparison interface  
- Analysis history and management
- Export and sharing capabilities
- Performance analytics and insights

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

### AC 2.6.1: Enhanced AI Analysis Progress Tracking
**Given** a user initiates multi-AI analysis with multiple models  
**When** the analysis is in progress  
**Then** the system should display:
- [ ] Individual progress bars for each selected AI model (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- [ ] Real-time status updates (pending, processing, completed, error) per model
- [ ] Estimated time remaining calculations based on model performance history
- [ ] Visual indicators for model health and availability during analysis
- [ ] Progress history timeline showing analysis stages and completion times
- [ ] Live error handling with retry options for failed models

### AC 2.6.2: Comprehensive Analysis Results Display
**Given** multi-AI analysis has completed for an uploaded file  
**When** viewing the analysis results  
**Then** the system should provide:
- [ ] Tabbed interface showing individual results from each AI model
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison view highlighting differences and similarities
- [ ] Consolidated insights panel combining findings from all models
- [ ] Confidence scoring visualization for each model's analysis
- [ ] Entity extraction comparison with conflict resolution
- [ ] Recommendation synthesis from multiple AI perspectives

### AC 2.6.3: Analysis History and Management
**Given** a user has performed multiple AI analyses  
**When** accessing the analysis management interface  
**Then** the system should display:
- [ ] Chronological list of all completed analyses with metadata
- [ ] Search and filter capabilities by date, models used, file type, status
- [ ] Quick preview of results without full result loading
- [ ] Bulk operations (delete, export, re-analyze) for multiple analyses
- [ ] Analysis performance metrics and usage statistics
- [ ] Favorite/bookmark functionality for important analyses

### AC 2.6.4: Export and Sharing Capabilities
**Given** completed AI analysis results  
**When** a user wants to export or share results  
**Then** the system should provide:

- [ ] Customizable report generation with selected insights
- [ ] Share links with proper access control and expiration
- [ ] Integration with course content and assignment submissions
- [ ] Comparison reports showing analysis evolution over time
- [ ] Print-friendly formatted results with proper styling

### AC 2.6.5: Real-time Progress WebSocket Integration
**Given** the WebSocket /analytics namespace provides real-time updates  
**When** AI analysis is running or completed  
**Then** the progress tracking should:
- [ ] Connect seamlessly to existing WebSocket infrastructure from Story 2.3
- [ ] Handle real-time model-specific progress updates without page refresh
- [ ] Display live notifications for analysis milestones and completion
- [ ] Maintain progress state during temporary disconnections
- [ ] Provide graceful fallback to HTTP polling if WebSocket unavailable
