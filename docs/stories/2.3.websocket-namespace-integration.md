**Story ID**: 2.3  
**Title**: WebSocket Namespace Integration Foundation  
**Epic**: 2.0 Frontend-Backend Integration Enhancement  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Draft  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Sprint**: 2 of Epic 2.0  
**Assignee**: Development Team  
**Date Created**: September 4, 2025

## 📋 Story Overview

Transform the generic WebSocket connection into specialized namespace-specific integrations, connecting the frontend to the four backend WebSocket namespaces (/analytics, /chat, /notifications, /collaboration) to enable real-time features throughout the application.

### 🎯 User Story

**As a** user of the LMS CNN system  
**I want** real-time updates and live interaction features  
**So that** I can receive instant notifications, participate in live chat, see analytics updates as they happen, and collaborate in real-time with other users

### 🏗️ Current State Analysis

**Current WebSocket Implementation**:
```typescript
// Generic WebSocket connection in useWebSocket.ts
const socket = io('http://localhost:3001', {
  autoConnect: false,
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling']
});

// Generic event subscription without namespace specialization
const subscribe = (event: string, callback: (data: any) => void) => {
  socket.on(event, callback);
};
```

**Backend Namespace Infrastructure Available**:
```typescript
// Backend WebSocket namespaces (Stories 1.3, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8)
✅ /analytics - Real-time analytics and progress updates
✅ /chat - Messaging and communication features  
✅ /notifications - Event-driven notifications
✅ /collaboration - Collaborative annotations and tools
```

**Target Namespace-Specific Integration**:
```typescript
// Specialized hooks for each namespace
useAnalyticsWebSocket() → Real-time analytics updates
useChatWebSocket() → Live messaging functionality
useNotificationsWebSocket() → Instant notifications
useCollaborationWebSocket() → Real-time collaboration features
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### AC 2.3.1: Analytics Namespace Integration
**Given** the backend provides WebSocket /analytics namespace  
**When** components need real-time analytics updates  
**Then** the system should:
- [ ] Connect to `/analytics` namespace with proper authentication
- [ ] Receive real-time progress updates for AI analysis jobs
- [ ] Get live updates for course engagement metrics
- [ ] Receive instant notifications for analytics milestones
- [ ] Handle analytics-specific events with proper typing
- [ ] Provide `useAnalyticsWebSocket()` hook for component integration

### AC 2.3.2: Chat Namespace Integration
**Given** the backend supports WebSocket /chat namespace  
**When** users engage in real-time communication  
**Then** the system should:
- [ ] Connect to `/chat` namespace with user authentication
- [ ] Send and receive messages in real-time
- [ ] Handle room-based messaging (course discussions, private chats)
- [ ] Manage user presence and typing indicators
- [ ] Provide message history synchronization
- [ ] Offer `useChatWebSocket()` hook for chat components

### AC 2.3.3: Notifications Namespace Integration
**Given** the backend provides WebSocket /notifications namespace  
**When** system events occur that require user notification  
**Then** the system should:
- [ ] Connect to `/notifications` namespace with user context
- [ ] Receive instant notifications for assignments, grades, and system events
- [ ] Handle notification priority levels and categorization
- [ ] Manage notification read/unread states
- [ ] Support notification preferences and filtering
- [ ] Provide `useNotificationsWebSocket()` hook for UI components

### AC 2.3.4: Collaboration Namespace Integration
**Given** the backend supports WebSocket /collaboration namespace  
**When** users collaborate on content and annotations  
**Then** the system should:
- [ ] Connect to `/collaboration` namespace with proper permissions
- [ ] Handle real-time annotation creation, updates, and deletions
- [ ] Manage collaborative editing sessions and user cursors
- [ ] Sync collaborative document states across users
- [ ] Handle conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- [ ] Provide `useCollaborationWebSocket()` hook for collaboration features

### AC 2.3.5: Connection Management and Resilience
**Given** the multi-namespace WebSocket architecture  
**When** network conditions change or connections fail  
**Then** the system should:
- [ ] Implement automatic reconnection for each namespace independently
- [ ] Provide graceful degradation to HTTP polling when WebSocket unavailable
- [ ] Handle authentication token refresh for persistent connections
- [ ] Display connection status for each namespace in the UI
- [ ] Queue and replay missed events during disconnection periods
