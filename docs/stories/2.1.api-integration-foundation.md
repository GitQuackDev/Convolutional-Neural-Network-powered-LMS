## 📋 Story Overview

Standardize API service usage across the frontend by migrating components from mixed API patterns (direct fetch(), hardcoded URLs, mock data) to a centralized apiService.ts architecture, establishing the foundation for systematic backend integration.

### 🎯 User Story

**As a** developer working on the LMS CNN system  
**I want** a standardized API service architecture across all frontend components  
**So that** I can efficiently integrate real backend APIs with consistent error handling, authentication, and request management

### 🏗️ Current State Analysis

**Problematic Patterns Identified**:
```typescript
// Pattern 1: Direct fetch() calls (4 locations in AnalyticsDashboard.tsx)
const response = await fetch('/api/analytics/overview?' + params);

// Pattern 2: Hardcoded API URLs scattered throughout components
const data = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/courses/user');

// Pattern 3: Mock data imports (majority of components)
import { mockCourses, mockAnalytics } from '@/data/mockData';

// Pattern 4: Inconsistent error handling
// No centralized error handling or loading states
```

**Target Architecture**:
```typescript
// Centralized API service with authentication, error handling, and typing
await apiService.get('/analytics/overview', { params });
await apiService.post('/ai-analysis/analyze-multi', { data });
```

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### AC 2.1.1: Enhanced API Service Architecture
**Given** the current apiService.ts exists but is only used for authentication  
**When** I enhance the API service with comprehensive endpoint support  
**Then** the service should provide methods for all backend endpoints with:
- [x] Consistent error handling and response transformation
- [x] Automatic authentication header management
- [x] Request/response interceptors for logging and monitoring
- [x] TypeScript types for all API responses
- [x] Loading state management integration

### AC 2.1.2: Analytics Dashboard API Migration
**Given** AnalyticsDashboard.tsx currently uses 4 direct fetch() calls  
**When** I migrate to the enhanced API service  
**Then** the dashboard should:
- [x] Use apiService.analytics.getOverview() instead of direct fetch
- [x] Use apiService.analytics.getEngagement() for engagement data
- [x] Use apiService.analytics.getAIModelsUsage() for AI metrics
- [x] Use apiService.analytics.exportData() for export functionality
- [x] Maintain identical UI behavior during migration
- [x] Include proper loading states and error handling

### AC 2.1.3: Content Annotation API Standardization
**Given** ContentAnnotationViewer.tsx and AnnotationManagement.tsx use mixed API patterns  
**When** I standardize their API usage  
**Then** these components should:
- [x] Use apiService.annotations.* methods for all annotation operations
- [x] Handle real-time updates via proper WebSocket integration hooks
- [x] Maintain existing UI functionality while connecting to real APIs
- [x] Include comprehensive error handling for annotation operations

### AC 2.1.4: API Response Type Safety
**Given** the backend APIs return structured data  
**When** I implement TypeScript types for all API responses  
**Then** the type system should:
- [x] Define interfaces for all analytics data structures
- [x] Define types for AI analysis request/response objects
- [x] Define annotation data types matching backend schemas
- [x] Provide compile-time validation for API usage
- [x] Export types for use in other components

### AC 2.1.5: Error Handling and Loading States
**Given** the enhanced API service architecture  
**When** components make API calls through the service  
**Then** error handling should:
- [x] Provide consistent error message formatting
- [x] Include retry mechanisms for transient failures
- [x] Display user-friendly error messages in the UI
- [x] Log detailed error information for debugging
- [x] Maintain component stability during error conditions
