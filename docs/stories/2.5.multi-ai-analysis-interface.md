## 📋 Story Overview

Build a comprehensive frontend interface for the multi-AI analysis workflow, connecting users to the OpenRouter integration backend (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) and enabling them to submit content for analysis, track progress in real-time, and view consolidated results from multiple AI models.

### 🎯 User Story

**As an** instructor or content creator using the LMS CNN system  
**I want** to analyze educational content using multiple AI models simultaneously  
**So that** I can get diverse insights, compare model perspectives, and make informed decisions about content quality, engagement, and educational effectiveness

### 🏗️ Current State Analysis

**Current AI Analysis Frontend State**:
```typescript
// useAIAnalysis.ts (436 lines) - Mostly mock data handling
export const useAIAnalysis = () => {
  const [analysis, setAnalysis] = useState<MultiAnalysisResult | null>(null);
  
  // CURRENT: Mock data simulation
  const analyzeContent = async (content: string, models: string[]) => {
    // Simulated analysis with hardcoded results
    return mockAnalysisResults;
  };
  
  // No real connection to backend AI services
};
```

**Backend AI Infrastructure Available (Stories 1.2, 1.5)**:
```typescript
✅ POST /api/ai-analysis/analyze-multi - Multi-model analysis initiation
✅ GET /api/ai-analysis/progress/:id - Real-time progress tracking
✅ GET /api/ai-analysis/consolidated/:id - Consolidated results retrieval
✅ WebSocket /analytics - Live progress updates and notifications
✅ OpenRouter Integration - GPT-4, Claude, Gemini model access
✅ AI Model Health Monitoring - Model availability and performance tracking
```

**Target AI Analysis User Experience**:
```typescript
// Complete AI analysis workflow
1. Content Upload/Input → Model Selection → Analysis Initiation
2. Real-time Progress Tracking → Live Updates via WebSocket
3. Individual Model Results → Consolidated Insights → Comparison View
4. Export Results → Integration with Course Content
```
