## üìã Story Overview

Replace mock analytics data throughout the dashboard with real-time data from the backend analytics aggregation service, enabling users to view actual learning analytics, AI model usage statistics, and engagement metrics while maintaining the existing UI design and user experience.

### üéØ User Story

**As a** instructor/admin using the LMS CNN analytics dashboard  
**I want** to see real learning analytics data instead of mock data  
**So that** I can make data-driven decisions about course effectiveness, student engagement, and AI model performance

### üèóÔ∏è Current State Analysis

**Mock Data Usage Identified**:
```typescript
// AnalyticsDashboard.tsx (455 lines) - Multiple mock data sources
import { mockAnalyticsData, mockEngagementMetrics } from '@/data/mockData';

// Current mock data patterns:
- Fixed engagement percentages (e.g., 85%, 92%, 78%)
- Hardcoded student counts and course statistics  
- Static AI model usage data
- Predetermined chart data points
- Mock user behavior patterns
```

**Target Real Data Integration**:
```typescript
// Connect to backend analytics aggregation service (Story 1.4)
- GET /api/analytics/overview ‚Üí Real course and engagement data
- GET /api/analytics/engagement ‚Üí Actual student interaction metrics
- GET /api/analytics/ai-models/usage ‚Üí Live AI model performance data
- WebSocket /analytics ‚Üí Real-time updates for dashboard metrics
```
