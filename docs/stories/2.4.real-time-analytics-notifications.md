## üìã Story Overview

Enhance the analytics dashboard and notification system to leverage the completed WebSocket namespace infrastructure (Story 2.3), connecting real-time analytics updates and instant notifications to provide users with live insights and immediate feedback.

### üéØ User Story

**As a** user of the LMS CNN system (student, professor, or admin)  
**I want** to see live analytics updates and receive instant notifications  
**So that** I can monitor progress in real-time, respond quickly to important events, and stay informed about system activities without refreshing pages

### üèóÔ∏è Current State Analysis

**Completed Infrastructure Available**:
```typescript
‚úÖ Story 2.3: WebSocket Namespace Integration Foundation
- useAnalyticsWebSocket() hook - Real-time analytics events
- useNotificationsWebSocket() hook - Instant notification delivery
- Connection management, authentication, reconnection logic
- Comprehensive event typing and error handling
```

**Current Analytics Dashboard State**:
```typescript
// AnalyticsDashboard.tsx - Using mock data and direct fetch()
üü° Component exists but not connected to real-time WebSocket
üü° Manual refresh required for updated data
üü° No live progress tracking for AI analysis jobs
üü° Static charts without real-time updates
```

**Current Notification System State**:
```typescript
// Basic notification infrastructure exists
üü° Toast notifications functional but no WebSocket integration
üü° No real-time delivery from backend events
üü° No notification categorization or priority handling
```

**Target State**:
```typescript
// Live Analytics Dashboard
‚úÖ Real-time metrics updates via WebSocket
‚úÖ Live AI analysis progress tracking
‚úÖ Instant engagement metric changes
‚úÖ Auto-refreshing charts and visualizations

// Enhanced Notification System  
‚úÖ Instant notification delivery via WebSocket
‚úÖ Categorized notifications (assignments, grades, system events)
‚úÖ Real-time notification count updates
‚úÖ Priority-based notification display
```
