## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript (backend & frontend), JavaScript
**Frameworks**: Express.js 5.1.0 (backend), React 19.1.1 (frontend), Vite (build)
**Database**: MongoDB with Prisma ORM
**Infrastructure**: Node.js runtime, JWT + Google OAuth authentication
**External Dependencies**: CNN analysis APIs, Multer + Sharp for file processing, shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM v7

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing MongoDB schema with new collections for analytics data (`user_analytics`, `session_metrics`, `ai_analysis_results`) and real-time communication (`chat_messages`, `notifications`, `collaboration_annotations`). Maintain existing Prisma models while adding new schemas for enhanced features.

**API Integration Strategy**: Extend current REST API with new endpoints (`/api/analytics/*`, `/api/chat/*`, `/api/ai-models/*`) while implementing WebSocket upgrade capabilities on existing Express.js server. Maintain current middleware stack (authentication, rate limiting, error handling) for all new endpoints.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Add new React components and hooks within existing architecture, extending current Zustand state management for real-time data, and integrating WebSocket client alongside existing API service layer. Maintain current React Router structure with new protected routes.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Vitest + Testing Library setup with WebSocket testing utilities and mock AI API responses. Maintain current testing patterns while adding real-time feature test coverage.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing monorepo organization adding `backend/src/services/aiModels/`, `backend/src/websocket/`, `frontend/src/components/analytics/`, and `frontend/src/components/communication/` directories while maintaining current separation of concerns.

**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing camelCase for JavaScript/TypeScript, kebab-case for file names, and PascalCase for React components. New AI services follow `AIModelService` pattern, analytics use `AnalyticsController` pattern.

**Coding Standards**: Continue TypeScript strict mode, ESLint configuration, and current Express.js middleware patterns. Real-time features must include proper error boundaries and WebSocket connection management following existing error handling patterns.

**Documentation Standards**: Extend existing JSDoc patterns for new services and components, maintain current API documentation format for new endpoints, and add WebSocket event documentation following project conventions.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Extend existing Vite build process with new analytics and real-time components, maintain current TypeScript compilation for backend services, and add environment variables for new AI model API keys without breaking existing CNN service configuration.

**Deployment Strategy**: Deploy enhanced features as backward-compatible updates to existing Express.js server, maintain current MongoDB connection patterns, and add WebSocket server capabilities without disrupting existing HTTP endpoints.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend current logging patterns with WebSocket connection monitoring, AI model API usage tracking, and analytics data processing metrics while maintaining existing error tracking and performance monitoring.

**Configuration Management**: Add new environment variables for AI model APIs, WebSocket settings, and analytics configurations while maintaining existing database and authentication configuration patterns.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- WebSocket connection stability at scale may impact existing HTTP performance
- Multiple AI model API dependencies could create single points of failure
- Real-time analytics processing may strain existing MongoDB performance
- Concurrent AI analysis requests could exceed current server memory limits

**Integration Risks**:
- New database schemas might conflict with existing Prisma migrations
- WebSocket upgrade process could interfere with current authentication middleware
- Real-time state management might conflict with existing React component lifecycle

**Deployment Risks**:
- Enhanced features could increase server resource requirements beyond current capacity
- New AI model API costs might exceed project budget constraints
- WebSocket infrastructure requires additional server configuration and monitoring

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement graceful degradation for real-time features falling back to polling
- Use circuit breaker patterns for AI model API calls with fallback to existing CNN analysis
- Implement database connection pooling and query optimization for analytics workloads
- Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting for new infrastructure components
