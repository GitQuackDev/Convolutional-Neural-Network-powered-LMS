# LMS CNN Integration System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Deliver an intelligent Learning Management System that combines traditional LMS functionality with CNN-powered content analysis for ICT/Tech education
• Achieve 1,000+ active students within first 6 months with 80%+ weekly engagement rates
• Reduce student research time by 70% through instant, comprehensive content analysis of uploaded materials
• Increase student performance metrics by 25% compared to traditional LMS usage through personalized learning experiences
• Enable 60%+ content discovery rate through AI-powered recommendations and smart categorization
• Reduce educator manual assessment time by 50% for visual/technical assignments through automated CNN analysis
• Process 10,000+ uploaded documents/images monthly with 90%+ accuracy in content categorization
• Secure partnerships with 5+ ICT/Tech educational institutions within first year

### Background Context
Current Learning Management Systems fail to meet the specific needs of ICT/Tech education, providing static learning environments without intelligent content analysis capabilities. Students upload technical diagrams, code screenshots, and hardware images but receive no contextual information, forcing them to manually research content outside the platform. Educators spend excessive time manually reviewing visual assignments while students struggle with generic learning paths that don't adapt to their individual performance patterns or learning behaviors.

The LMS CNN Integration System addresses this critical gap by combining proven LMS workflow patterns (Skool.com's step-by-step progress tracking with Google Classroom's assignment management) with revolutionary CNN-powered intelligence. This creates the first learning platform specifically designed for technical education that transforms every upload into a learning opportunity through automated content analysis, Wikipedia integration, and intelligent categorization using free AI models, making advanced educational features accessible without high operational costs.

### Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH Priority:**
1. **API Integration Specifications:** Need detailed documentation of Hugging Face, Wikipedia, and OpenRouter API integration requirements
2. **Data Schema Requirements:** Database entities and relationships need explicit definition
3. **Error Handling Specifications:** More detailed error scenarios and recovery procedures needed

**MEDIUM Priority:**
1. **User Research Documentation:** While we have project brief insights, formal user research validation would strengthen requirements
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Need specific metrics and monitoring approach for CNN analysis performance
3. **Security Testing Requirements:** More detailed security testing procedures for educational data

**LOW Priority:**
1. **Advanced Analytics Specifications:** Some analytics features could be more detailed
2. **Mobile Optimization Details:** Mobile experience could be more specifically defined

### MVP Scope Assessment

**Appropriate Scope:**
- 6 epics provide logical progression from foundation to advanced features
- Each epic delivers tangible value independently
- Core LMS functionality established before adding AI differentiation
- Realistic for 3-6 month timeline with 1-3 developer team

**Well-Prioritized Features:**
- Authentication and course management provide immediate institutional value
- CNN integration as Epic 4 allows for technical validation without blocking basic LMS
- Analytics last ensures sufficient data for meaningful insights

**No Recommended Cuts:** All features support core value proposition and MVP objectives

### Technical Readiness

**Strong Foundation:**
- Clear technology stack decisions with rationale
- Appropriate architecture choices for team size and constraints
- Well-defined integration approach with external AI services

**Areas for Architect Investigation:**
- CNN analysis pipeline optimization for 10-second response time requirement
- Database schema design for flexible content categorization
- Caching strategy for Wikipedia API and CNN analysis results

### Recommendations

**Before Architecture Phase:**
1. **Document API Integration Details:** Create detailed specifications for Hugging Face, Wikipedia, and OpenRouter integrations
2. **Define Data Schema:** Outline database entities, relationships, and data flow patterns
3. **Specify Error Handling:** Detail error scenarios, user feedback, and recovery procedures

**Next Steps:**
1. Save current PRD to `docs/prd.md`
2. Proceed with architecture design using this PRD as foundation
3. Create technical specification document addressing API and data schema details

### Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and provides clear foundation for architectural design. The identified gaps are minor and can be addressed during architecture phase or as technical specifications.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

**Initiate UX Design Phase for LMS CNN Integration System**

You are tasked with creating the user experience design for an AI-powered Learning Management System that combines traditional LMS functionality with CNN-powered content analysis for ICT/Tech education. 

**Key Design Priorities:**
- Design intuitive interfaces for CNN content analysis with real-time feedback display
- Create seamless integration between traditional LMS workflows (course management, assignments, grading) and AI-powered features
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG AA) with responsive design across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Implement OKLCH color theming system for institutional branding flexibility
- Focus on the unique upload-and-analyze workflow that differentiates this platform

**Core User Flows to Design:**
1. Professor course creation and student management workflows
2. Student assignment submission with integrated CNN analysis
3. Comprehensive grading interface with AI-assisted evaluation
4. Discussion forums with anonymous participation options
5. Analytics dashboards for both students and professors

**Technical Constraints:**
- React + TypeScript frontend with TailwindCSS and Shadcn/ui components
- Must accommodate 10-second CNN analysis response times with engaging progress indicators
- Integration points for Hugging Face models, Wikipedia API, and file upload processing

Please review the complete PRD above and begin UX design phase focusing on wireframes, user flows, and interaction patterns that support both traditional educational workflows and innovative AI-enhanced learning experiences.
